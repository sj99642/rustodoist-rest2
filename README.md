A wrapper for the Todoist REST v2 API.

Currently a work in progress; all project and task actions the REST API allows are implemented,
but sections, comments, and labels are not. I expect everything to be fully implemented within a week or two. 

See https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/ for more information on the Todoist REST API, or
https://docs.rs/rustodoist_rest2/latest/rustodoist_rest2/ for the documentation for this crate.
