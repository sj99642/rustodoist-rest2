A wrapper for the Todoist REST v2 API.

Currently a work in progress; all project, task and label actions the REST API allows are implemented,
but sections and comments are not.

See https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/ for more information on the Todoist REST API, or
https://docs.rs/todoist-v2-rest/latest/todoist_v2_rest/ for the documentation for this crate.

Please report any bugs on the GitHub repository at https://github.com/sj99642/todoist-v2-rest.
